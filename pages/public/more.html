	    			<p>The first reported case and the initial reaction to COVID-19</p>
	    			<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, with no known cause on December 31, 2019, marking the first official cases of COVID-19. China's authorities identified a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, as the cause of these illnesses on January 7th.</p>
	    			<p>On the 30th of January 2020, the WHO classified the fast expanding COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. However, it wasn't until the 11th of February the following month that the novel coronavirus was given an official name: COVID-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first COVID-19 death in the country nine days later. The individual was a Washington state resident in his fifties.</p>

	    			<h3>Declaring COVID-19 a pandemic</h3>
	    		</div>
	    		<div class="px-4 card-body">
	    			<p>COVID-19 began with global health authorities, government agencies, and the general public apprehensive of how the disease would spread and effect daily life. The United Nations released $15 million on March 1st, 2020 to help the worldwide COVID-19 response. COVID-19 instances surpassed 100,000 a week later, on March 7th. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO several days later, on March 11th. COVID-19 went from a serious concern that seemed to be exclusive to China to a global health emergency practically quickly.</p>
	    			<p>Following the implementation of exceptional steps to contain the virus, the situation in Wuhan had calmed down by this time. China was reporting thousands of new cases each day at the start of the outbreak, but by March, that number had dropped to a few dozens. Cases in Europe, on the other hand, were fast increasing day by day, with Italy registering an astonishing 250 deaths between March 12th and March 13th. As a result, the WHO determined on March 13th that Europe had become the pandemic's epicenter. The United States proclaimed a state of emergency on the same day.</p>

	    			<p>New variants change the course of the pandemic.</p>
	    			<p>Due of the constraints their people had to face to prevent the spread of the virus, many countries observed a decline in cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities over the summer. The Lambda variety was first identified in Peru near the conclusion of the summer, in August 2020. According to the WHO, this variety has now spread to at least 29 nations.</p><p>The Alpha version was first discovered in the UK a month later, in September 2020. These variants' identification was crucial since it indicated that the virus was changing. As a result, disease symptoms and outcomes were shifting. For example, evidence suggests that the Alpha variation may increase the chance of poor COVID-19 outcomes.</p><p>With the introduction of these new varieties, COVID-19 cases began to grow again in many nations, and by September 29, 2020, 1 million COVID-19 deaths had occurred.</p>
